We want to explore the city on foot, try iconic local food, and visit Chinatown, Alcatraz, and Golden Gate Park.
Additionally, I am planning to propose during this trip and need a special location recommendation for a romantic moment.

Please provide a detailed itinerary with daily activities, transportation suggestions, and must-visit spots.
We would also appreciate essential travel tips to make the most of our visit.‚Äù""",
